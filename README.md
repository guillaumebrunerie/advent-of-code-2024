Advent of Code 2024 in Javascript
---------------------------------

The code for day n is in the file `n/solve.js`, the test input in the file
`n/testInput.txt`, and the actual input in the file `n/input.txt`.

Running `./run` will run the code of the current day, and set up a template if
there isnâ€™t one already.
